pyvib
=====

Pyvib is a python program for analyzing nonlinear vibrations and estimating(and
simulating) models from measured data.

The highlights are

- Analyzing (working on data):
   **Restoring force surface** (RFS) to visualize the functional form of the
   nonlinearties.

   **Wavelet transform** gives a frequency and time resolution plots from where
   the type of nonlinearity can be deducted.

   **Quantification of noise and nonlinear distortion** using the best linear
   approximation (BLA).
* Modeling (working on data):
   White box, using subspace identification and specified polynomials and
   splines to model the identified nonlinearities, known as **frequency
   nonlinear system identification** (FNSI).

   Black box, using **polynomial nonlinear state-space** (PNLSS).
* Understanding (working on identified FE model):
   **Harmonic balance continuation** to reveal bifurcations and jumps

   **Nonlinear normal modes** to reveal internal resonances and energy transfer
   between modes [#nnm]_.

The :doc:`user-guide` provides a detailed description of the `pnlss example
<https://github.com/pawsen/pyvib/tree/master/examples/pnlss/tutorial.py>`_, to
show how pyvib works. See the `examples directory
<https://github.com/pawsen/pyvib/tree/master/examples>`_ for additional examples.

The :doc:`modules/index` documentation provides API-level documentation.
:doc:`contributing` shows how to contribute to the program or report bugs.

The PNLSS functionality is a translation of a matlab program written by the
staff at `Vrije Universiteit Brussel
<http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~ktiels/pnlss.html>`_ (VUB) . The documentation is
written by `Koen Tiels <https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N18-309>`_ and he have
also written a short primer on `pnlss <http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~ktiels/pnlss_v1_0.pdf>`_

The FNSI method is developed by `Jean-Philippe Noël <http://www.jpnoel.be>`_. He
also kindly provided a matlab implementation of the spline method during my
thesis.
