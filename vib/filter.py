def integrate(ddy,fs, lowcut=None, highcut=None, order=3, isnumeric=False):
    """Integrate acceleration to get velocity and displacement.

    Numerical integration is prone to low-frequency problems.
    Trapez-rule only have problems with low-freq, but is imprecise from
    0.1*nyquist freq.
    Simpsons and Tick's rule or give better precision, but have problems with
    high frequencies as well as low. They can(and should) be used until 1/4 of
    nyquist freq. See fig. I.9 p. 618 [1]_.

    Instead of using band-pass filter, using low pass filter for measurement
    (acceleration) to remove noise and then high pass filter for integrated
    signals (velocity and position) for removing drift, yields better
    integrated signals.

    Only filter ẏ (dy) after y have been calculated: In reality ẏ is zero-mean,
    but a finite sampling will cause it to be non-zero mean. If we now:
    ∫ ẏ(t) - ẏ_mean dt = y - ẏ_mean*t + k1
    Ie. filtering ẏ before integration, introduce a linear trend in y
    (ẏ_mean*t) that then has to be removed somehow. k1 is the integration
    constant. We choose y(0) = 0, ie k1 = 0.

    The cutoff frequencies are normalized with the Nyquist frequency (ie. 1 is
    the nyquist frequency). After filtering, they are the frequencies where the
    gain drops to 1/sqrt(2) of that of the passband (the "-3 dB point").

    Parameters:
    ----------
    lowcut : float
        Cutoff frequency in Hz for the highpass filtering of integrated
        signals.
    Highcut : float
        Cutoff frequency in Hz for the lowpass filtering of acceleration signal
        before integrating.
    isnumeric : bool
        Only filter 'real data'. Simulated data without noise should not be
        filtered
