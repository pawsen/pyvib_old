    Efficient implementation. Find the factorization by trial division, using
    the optimization of dividing only by two and the odd integers.

    An improvement on trial division by two and the odd numbers is wheel
    factorization, which uses a cyclic set of gaps between potential primes to
    greatly reduce the number of trial divisions. Here we use a 2,3,5-wheel

    Factoring wheels have the same O(sqrt(n)) time complexity as normal trial
    division, but will be two or three times faster in practice.
