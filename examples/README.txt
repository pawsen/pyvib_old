Missing data
===============
The examples includes files for generating data needed for the identification
process(ie. FNSI, RFS, FRF, WT), but the data itself is not included. Data can
either be generated by running the relevant files or downloaded from [1] and
then extracted to the relevant directories.

Structure
===========
In general the structure is:

Data generation
------------------
Depending on the DOFs, data can either be generated by ode.py, pyds.py or nm.py.
ode.py and pyds.py solves a system of 1.order ODEs, ie. the state-space
formulation, whereas nm uses a newmark solver on the FEM formulation.

ode.py uses the built-in ode-solver in numpy(or scipy) where pyds needs an
external package downloaded from [2]. pyds is much faster as the ode-system is
compiled into c-code. ode.py is only provided as an example, as I use pyds or
newmark.

Identification
-----------------
wt.py
rfs.py
fnsi.py
